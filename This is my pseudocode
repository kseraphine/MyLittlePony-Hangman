This is my pseudocode

We need some variables:
var userGuess; THE LETTER THE USER GUESSED
var numWins; number of wins to display on page
var guessesLeft; number of guesses remaining, display on page
var wrongLetter = []; array of wrong guesses because we have to display it and number of guesses shouldnt go down if user gueses same letter twice

var rightLetter = []; array because we have to display the correct guesses or we could append to the previous w
var word = {
	firstword: [f', 'i', 'r', 's', 't'],
	secondword: ['s', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'n', 'd'],
	}

alert = you've already guessed that!

document.onkeyup = function(event){
 var letter =

array.prototype.forEach
